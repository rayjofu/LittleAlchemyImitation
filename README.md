# LittleAlchemyImitation

This is an abridged imitation of the Little Alchemy game using PyQt and Python.

You can modify the recipes through recipe_input.txt.

Basic components need to be in the following format:
component1=
component2=
component3=

Recipes need to be in the following format:
result=component1+component2
result2=component2+component3
result3=component3+component4
